# Arduino Obstacle Avoiding Robot
This project aims to make a simple Arduino obstacle avoidong car.

List of components I used:
- Arduino Uno (with cable) (x1)
- IR Sensor Modules (x3)
- L293D/L298N Motor Driver (x1)
- B.O DC Motors (x2)
- Bread Board (x1)
- A generic chasis (x1)
- Jumper wires (as much as you need)
- Batteries to power both the Arduino and L293D
- 9V battery connector (x2)

# Functionalities
The basic function of the robot is to detect an object, by reading the data from 3 IR sensors. Depending on which IR sensor detects an obstacle, the robot will reverse and devitae either left or right of the obstacle.

***Note:*** *In the video, the robot pauses for a bit before avoiding, this is because the battery was running out at the time of recording.*

Sorry for the poor video quality. I will try to make better videos for any future projects.
